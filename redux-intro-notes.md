### Sean's Plans

* Redux confusing enough that he will not send us out on our own.
* we will all get words to speak about:
  * state
  * action
  * reduce
  * store
  * listener
  * dispatch
  * subscribe

#### Workflow
* change theme/profile in the terminal
* git init
* npm init
* create webpack.config.js
* npm install webpack --dev
* create folders, app, tests...
* put index.js fill in the app folder
* npm install tape --dev
* npm install faucet tap-diff tap-dot --save-dev
* tests.test.js in test folder

### Testing
